openiboot image resources
-------------------------

These are the images used for the menu items in the openiboot boot menu. They
are pretty temporary because they are very ugly. If someone would like to
design a better menu, please contact me.

As it is, these images are generated using GIMP, exporting to a C header file,
and then slightly modified to make the HEADER_PIXEL nested inside an ifndef.
The position of the two images here on the screen are hardcoded inside menu.c.

The icons used in the images are from Wikimedia Commons. The console icon is
LGPL licensed and the apple icon is a public domain work by Oleg Alexandrov.
The font used is DejaVu Sans Bold.
